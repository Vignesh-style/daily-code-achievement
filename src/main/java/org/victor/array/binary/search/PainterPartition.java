/** //todo Classic Problem.
 * Scaler problem :: Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
 * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

 * Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
 NOTE:
 * 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 * 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
 * 3. Return the ans % 10000003.

 Problem Constraints

 1 <= A <= 1000
 1 <= B <= 10^6
 1 <= N <= 10^5
 1 <= C[i] <= 10^6
